 * PROBLEM:  Agram is a card game for 2 players, using the cards from a standard 52-card pack. 
 * The dealer deals five cards to each player. The opponent player leads any card, playing it face up in the middle of the playing area.
 * 
 * For this program the following strategy will be used to determine which card the dealer will play:
 * The dealer must play a card of the same suit if he can.  
 * He plays the lowest card in that suit that is of a higher rank than the card the opponent played. 
 * If he does not have such a card, he plays his lowest card in that suit.  
 * If he does not have a card in that suit, he plays the lowest ranking card regardless of suit. We guarantee there will be no ties.
 * 
 * INPUT:  There will be 5 lines of input.  Each line will contain the opponentâ€™s lead card and the 5 cards held by the dealer.  
 * All cards will be represented by 2-character strings in value-suit order. AH represents the ace of hearts.  K, Q and J and T will be used for king, queen, jack and 10 respectively.  
 * Note that the ace in this game has the lowest rank.
 * OUTPUT:  For each input line print the card the dealer must play according to the strategy listed above.  
 * 
 * SAMPLE INPUT                     SAMPLE OUTPUT
 * 1.  5D, 2D, 6H, 9D, TD, 6H                   1.  9D ******************
 * 2.  TC, AC, KC, QH, JS, TD                   2.  KC ******************
 * 3.  3D, 4H, 5C, 6S, 2D, 7H                   3.  2D
 * 4.  KS, TH, QC, 7H, 9H, 3H                   4.  3H
