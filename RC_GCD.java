 * Finds the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean Algorithm
 * 
 * The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(A,B) is as follows:
 * If A = 0 then GCD(A,B)=B, since the GCD(0,B)=B, and we can stop.
 * If B = 0 then GCD(A,B)=A, since the GCD(A,0)=A, and we can stop.
 * Write A in quotient remainder form (A = Bâ‹…Q + R)
 * Find GCD(B,R) using the Euclidean Algorithm since GCD(A,B) = GCD(B,R)
