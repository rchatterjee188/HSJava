 * Type conversion. We often find ourselves converting data from one type to another using one of the following approaches.
Explicit type conversion. Call methods such as Math.round(), Integer.parseInt(), and Double.parseDouble().
Automatic type conversion. For primitive numeric types, the system automatically performs type conversion when we use a value whose type has a larger range of values than expected.
Explicit casts. Java also has some built-in type conversion methods for primitive types that you can use when you are aware that you might lose information, but you have to make your intention using something called a cast. RandomInt.java reads an integer command-line argument n and prints a "random" integer between 0 and nâˆ’1.
Automatic conversions for strings. The built-in type String obeys special rules. One of these special rules is that you can easily convert any type of data to a String by using the + operator.
